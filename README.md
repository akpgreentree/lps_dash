An app for looking at the results of topic modeling on some timecourse data. 
It has three components:
* Timecourse topic plot: shows the percent of topics in each tissue over the timecourse
* Z-score table: shows genes in order of Z-score for a given topic
* beta table: shows genes in order of beta for a given topic

Click on a topic in the timecourse plot to look at that topic in the tables. Click on forward and back buttons in tables to page through the genes, and use the dropdowns to switch between positive and negative scores.

The line plots in the tables are normalized counts for the gene over the timecourse for each of the tissues.
